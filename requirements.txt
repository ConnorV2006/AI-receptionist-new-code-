# Include a Postgres driver. Render uses PostgreSQL by default, so we need
# psycopg2-binary to allow SQLAlchemy to communicate with the database. If
# you prefer the non-binary distribution or are compiling from source, you
# may use `psycopg2` instead. See README for details.

# OpenAI client library for generating AI summaries of incoming messages.
# This package is optional but recommended if you want automatic
# summarisation of patient messages via the OpenAI API. If you don't
# configure an OPENAI_API_KEY in your environment, the application will
# gracefully fall back to returning the original message.
